2.	Render a calendar that spans as many weeks as necessary in order to cover the defined number of days. If the date range spans months, a new header needs to be created for that month. The Calendar should display its days starting on Sunday and ending on Saturday, as shown below. This should work with any number of days regardless of the years meaning that if the user specifies more than 365 days, calendars will be generated accordingly for the next year and so on.
